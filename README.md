## Some info about me

My real name is Vildan. I`ve been started my programming learning ÑˆÑ‚ August 2021. Since this time, after I have learned js, html, css and when I"ve made 5 landing pages as pet projects
I started to make projects on freelance. It was simple HTML pages, SPA. after that I got a job at krak.ai as frontend developer and work there to this day.
